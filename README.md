# Google's Gemini Integration in Telegram

The Telegram Gemini Project is a Ruby application designed to interact with users via text messages or visualize images based on user queries. It utilizes the Telegram Bot API for communication and integrates with the Gemini API for generating content.

## Description

This project enables users to interact with a Telegram bot by sending text messages or images. The bot processes the user input, performs queries using the Gemini API, and returns relevant responses or visualizations. It leverages natural language processing (NLP) and image recognition technologies to understand user queries and provide accurate outputs.

## Features

- **Text Interaction**: Users can communicate with the bot by sending text messages.
- **Image Visualization**: Users can send images to the bot, which will be processed to generate visualizations based on the content.
- **Natural Language Processing**: The bot utilizes NLP techniques to understand user queries and provide meaningful responses.
- **Image Recognition**: Images sent to the bot are analyzed using image recognition algorithms to extract relevant information.
